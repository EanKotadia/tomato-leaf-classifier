# Tomato Leaf Disease Classifier

AI-Powered Web Tool for Early Detection of Plant Diseases  
By *Ean Kotadia – Class 10 E* | Summer Science Project

---

## Overview

This project is a web-based image classifier that identifies common diseases in tomato leaves using machine learning. It was developed using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and deployed as part of a science vacation homework assignment.

The model helps detect:
- Healthy Leaves
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- Leaf Mold

The goal is to explore how AI and computer vision can be applied in agriculture to assist with crop monitoring and disease prevention.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Images of tomato leaves (healthy and diseased) were collected.
2. **Model Training**  
   The model was trained using Google’s Teachable Machine image classification tool.
3. **Deployment**  
   The model was exported and integrated into a static website using TensorFlow.js.
4. **User Interaction**  
   The site allows users to upload leaf images or use a webcam to predict the disease.

## Live Demo

You can try out the classifier directly on the hosted website:  
[Try the Classifier](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/WZC3cVtAX/embed.html)

Alternatively, the model is also embedded in the main project webpage.
