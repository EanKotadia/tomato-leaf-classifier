                Learn how the Tomato Leaf Disease Classifier was developed as an independent student science project,
                which uses machine learning to recognize plant diseases from leaf images.
                This platform is intended exclusively for experimentation and learning.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Tomato Leaf Disease Classifier is a self-initiated educational project created by Ean Kotadia,
                a Class 10 E student.
                The goal is to explore how computer vision models can assist in early detection of plant health issues.

                The primary objectives of this project were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how machine learning models are trained on labeled image data.</li>
                <li>Practice collecting and categorizing example images of healthy and diseased leaves.</li>
                <li>Deploy an interactive web-based classifier that predicts disease types.</li>
                <li>Highlight the potential benefits and limitations of AI in agriculture.</li>
                <li>Encourage other students to explore computer vision for real-world challenges.</li>

            <h2>Data Sources and Collection</h2>
            <p>
                The model was trained using photographs collected and organized into categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthy Leaves:</strong> Fresh, green tomato leaves without visible discoloration.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Blight:</strong> Leaves showing brown concentric spots and yellowing edges.</li>
                <li><strong>Late Blight:</strong> Dark lesions and rapid tissue decay.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Mold:</strong> Yellow patches with fuzzy growth on the underside.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Images were manually labeled and uploaded to Teachable Machine to build the classifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional sample images were used to validate the model’s predictions.

            <h2>Modeling Techniques</h2>
            <p>
                The classifier uses Teachable Machine’s image recognition framework, which applies transfer learning
                on a pre-trained MobileNet architecture. This enables accurate predictions even with a small dataset.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Teachable Machine:</strong> Web-based tool for training and exporting TensorFlow.js models.
                </li>
                <li><strong>TensorFlow.js:</strong> Library to run the model directly in the browser without a backend
                    server.</li>
                <li><strong>Client-Side Prediction:</strong> Image files are processed in the browser to classify leaf
                    health.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The model is intentionally lightweight so it loads quickly and can be tested on most devices.

            <h2>Output Features</h2>
            <p>
                When a user uploads or captures a photo of a tomato leaf, the system:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Displays the predicted class label (e.g., Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold).</li>
                <li>Shows the confidence score for each prediction.</li>
                <li>Provides simple guidance on what the result means.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All predictions are for demonstration and learning purposes only.

            <h2>Limitations and Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a student experiment and has not been validated by agricultural experts.
                It should not be used for actual diagnosis or treatment decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Model accuracy depends on image quality, lighting, and dataset size.
                For professional advice, consult qualified agronomists.
